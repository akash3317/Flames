welcome to Navigation to Marse rover path finding algorithms.
Algorithms used:-

-->DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM
        it is the father of all path finding algorithms
        guarantee the shortest path.  

-->A* SEARCH
         it is the best path finding algorithm
         guarantee the shortest path.
         faster than dijkstra's algorithm.

-->BEST-FIRST SEARCH
         heuristic-heavy version of A*
         does't guarantee the shortest path.

-->BREATH-FIRST SEARCH (bfs)
         guarantee the shortest path.

-->DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH (dfs)
        too bad algorithm.
        slow.
        doesn't guarantee the shortest path.
